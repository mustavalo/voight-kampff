# VOIGHT-KAMPFF
## An experimentation in music visualization.

### Created by KAPITAN! / Lauri-Matti Parppei

_Requires Paper.js and Howler.js libraries._

__Please note:__ I am not a coder and I don't have much experience with writing any code 
whatsoever. All of what you see here was learned from scratch and built from the ground up 
after numerous hours of errors and mistakes, so please excuse all the bad practices. 
The strangest parts I've tried to explain, but still it's sort of a mess. Dread lightly!

The core of all this is the rendering queue, you can add your own animations pretty easily
and add better control interfaces.

As most of the interface uses PaperScope in some way, I've kept everything in
this same file. And to be honest, I didn't really get it working split into multiple
script files. A more experienced programmer could really squeeze everything into a single 
class and extend it.

Hopefully this will inspire some better and fancier things and help those trying to
create something of their own. 

I've edited out some PHP things from this open source version to get it working locally
without a HTTP server - there are remains of some of that stuff.

__Future considerations__
* Clearing the music video concept out of this and making it more of a procedural animation tool. Also some effects/animations that affect everything on the canvas.
* MIDI controls maybe? (http://www.keithmcmillen.com/blog/making-music-in-the-browser-web-midi-api/)
* Standalone version without the music things 
* Node.js support?

The whole thing is released under the MIT License. 

Thank you and good luck.
